## 1. Basics

**All challenges that deal with the Person class is stored in: person_oop_exercise.py**

Given the following Person class:

```
class Person: def __init__(self, name, email, phone): 
     self.name = name 
     self.email = email 
     self.phone = phone 

     def greet(self, other_person): 
     print('Hello {}, I am {}!'.format(other_person.name, self.name))
```

### Write code to

1. Instantiate an instance object of Person with name of 'Sonny', email of 'sonny@hotmail.com', and phone of '483-485-4948', store it in the variable sonny.
2. Instantiate another person with the name of 'Jordan', email of 'jordan@aol.com', and phone of '495-586-3456', store it in the variable 'jordan'.
3. Have sonny greet jordan using the greet method.
4. Have jordan greet sonny using the greet method.
5. Write a print statement to print the contact info (email and phone) of Sonny.
6. Write another print statement to print the contact info of Jordan.

## 2. Make your own class

**Solution is stored in: vehicle_oop.py**

Create a class Vehicle. A Vehicle object will have 3 attributes:

* make
* model
* year

A vehicle is created thus:

    car = Vehicle('Nissan', 'Leaf', 2015)

And you can access it's attributes individually like so:

    print(car.make, car.model, car.year)

## Add a method

Add a print_info method to the Vehicle class. It will print out the vehicle's information like so:

    >>> car.print_info() 2015 Nissan Leaf

## Add a method 2

Go back to the Person class. Add a print_contact_info method to the Person class that will print out the contact info for a object instance of Person. You will use it thus:

    >>> sonny.print_contact_info() 
    Sonny's email: sonny@hotmail.com, Sonny's phone number: 483-485-4948

## Add an instance variable (attribute)

Add a friends instance variable (attribute) to the Person class. You will initialize it to an empty list within the constructor __init__. Once you've done this you should be able to add a friend to a person using list's append method:

    jordan.friends.append(sonny) 
    sonny.friends.append(jordan)

You should also be able to get the number of friends a person has by using the len function on his friends:

    >>> len(jordan.friends) 1

## Add a add_friend method

The fact that a person's friends attribute is a list is an implementation detail of the Person class. It is often desired to hide implementation details from the users of your object/class. Implement an add_friend method to Person, so that in order to add a friend, you'd only have to do:

    jordan.add_friend(sonny)

Instead of

    jordan.friends.append(sonny)

## Add a num_friends method

Similarly, to get the number of friends a person has, we'd like to hide the implementation detail that there is a friends attribute which is a list. Implement a num_friends method which returns the number of friends the person currently has:

    >>> jordan.num_friends() 1

## Count number of greetings

We want to count the number of times a person has greeted someone. To do this, we'll add another attribute, call it say greeting_count, and initialize it to 0. Then each time the greet method is called, we'll increment greeting_count by 1.

    >>> sonny.greeting_count 
    0 
    >>> sonny.greet(jordan) 
    >>> sonny.greeting_count 
    1 
    >>> sonny.greet(jordan) 
    >>> sonny.greeting_count 
    2
## __str__

You may notice that when you are working with a person object, it's representation in the Python shell is pretty cryptic and unhelpful:

    >>> print(jordan) 
    <__main__.Person object at 0x106976410>

You can change that! Just add a __ str __ method to the Person class and have it return a string. Whatever you return there will be used to "represent" your person object. For example, say I want a Person to be represented like Person: Jordan jordan@aol.com 495-586-3456, I could implement __ str __ thus:

    def __str__(self): 
        return 'Person: {} {} {}'.format(self.name, self.email, self.phone)
        
Implement your own __ str __ method, and you can represent your person objects however you want. Incidentally, __ str __ is also used when you use convert your object to a string: str(jordan).

## Bonus Challenge
Keep track of the number of unique people a person has greeted, and be able to report that number via the num_unique_people_greeted method:

    >>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted()
    0 
    >>> sonny.greet(jordan) 
    >>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted() 
    1 
    >>> sonny.greet(jordan) 
    >>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted() 
    1 
    >>> sonny.greet(dee_ann) 
    >>> sonny.num_unique_people_greeted() 
    2
